# FAIR metadata generator

A simple command line Python script to generate rich metadata descriptions of datasets in JSON-LD and RDF using Schema.org and PROV-O vocabulary

The script ``fairmetadatagenerator.py`` asks users to answer a set of pre-determined questions about their dataset. The answers are used to generate a metadata description of their dataset in JSON-LD and RDF formats which are then meant to be published in metadata registries such as https://fairsharing.org/

The script generates the description primarily using https://schema.org/ and https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ vocabulary to make the metadata descriptions computable and interpretable by software.
